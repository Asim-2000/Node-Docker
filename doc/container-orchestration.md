## Container Orchestration

Container orchestration is the automation of all aspects of coordinating and managing containers. Container orchestration is focused on managing the life cycle of containers and their dynamic environments.

### Why Container Orchestration?
Container orchestration automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. Enterprises that need to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of LinuxÂ® containers and hosts can benefit from container orchestration.
